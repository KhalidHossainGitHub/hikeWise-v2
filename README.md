# HikeWise

**HikeWise** is a trail difficulty visualizer built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Mapbox GL JS**, and the **Open-Meteo API**. Upload a GPX route file and instantly see segment-by-segment difficulty color-coded on a 3-D satellite map with real terrain elevation and live weather data. The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Overview

HikeWise enables hikers and outdoor enthusiasts to:

- **Upload GPX Routes**: Drag-and-drop or use the file picker to load any GPX file containing trackpoints with elevation data. Alternatively, choose from a selection of pre-loaded sample trails to explore instantly.
- **Visualize Difficulty on a 3-D Map**: View your entire route rendered on a Mapbox satellite map with real DEM terrain exaggeration, atmospheric sky layer, and smooth camera transitions.
- **Analyze Segment Difficulty**: The route is split into segments, each scored and color-coded — 🟢 Easy, 🟡 Moderate, or 🔴 Hard — based on elevation grade and real-time weather conditions at the trail's location.
- **Explore Segments Interactively**: Click any segment in the sidebar list to highlight it on the map and fly to its location for a closer look.
- **View Route Summary**: See key stats at a glance — total distance, total ascent, average grade, maximum difficulty score, current temperature, and precipitation.
- **Switch Map Styles**: Toggle between Satellite, Streets, and Outdoors map styles while preserving 3-D terrain.

## Features

- **GPX Parsing**: Parses GPX files using `@mapbox/togeojson` with a manual XML fallback, extracting latitude, longitude, and elevation from every trackpoint.
- **3-D Satellite Map**: Powered by Mapbox GL JS with `satellite-streets-v12` style, real DEM terrain (1.4× exaggeration), atmospheric sky layer, and smooth animated camera transitions.
- **Difficulty Scoring Algorithm**: Each segment receives a numeric score based on its elevation grade and current weather penalties, then classified as Easy, Moderate, or Hard.
- **Color-Coded Route Segments**: Segments are drawn directly on the map with difficulty-based colors — green for easy, amber for moderate, and red for hard.
- **Live Weather Integration**: Fetches today's max temperature and precipitation sum from the free Open-Meteo API using the route's midpoint coordinates.
- **Interactive Segment List**: A scrollable sidebar list of all segments with distance, elevation gain, grade, and difficulty badge — click to fly-to on the map.
- **Route Summary Card**: Displays total distance (km), total ascent (m), average grade (%), max difficulty score, temperature (°C), and precipitation (mm).
- **Sample Trails**: Five pre-loaded Ontario trails (Bruce Trail, Centennial Ridges, Niagara Whirlpool Loop, Orchard & Vista Loop, Rouge Valley Loop) available for instant exploration without uploading a file.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on desktop and mobile. On desktop, the sidebar slides in from the left. On mobile, it transforms into a bottom drawer with a swipe handle and a peek bar showing key stats, expandable to reveal the full panel.

## Difficulty Algorithm

The difficulty of each segment is calculated using a combination of terrain steepness and real-time weather conditions:

```
score = 20                             // base difficulty
      + |segment_grade_%| × 3         // steeper grade = harder
      + (temperature > 30 °C ? 15 : 0) // heat penalty
      + (precipitation > 2 mm ? 10 : 0) // rain penalty
```

The segment grade is computed as `(elevation gain / horizontal distance) × 100`. The raw score is then classified into three difficulty levels:

| Score Range | Level | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Below 40 | 🟢 Easy | Green (`#22c55e`) |
| 40 – 70 | 🟡 Moderate | Amber (`#f59e0b`) |
| Above 70 | 🔴 Hard | Red (`#ef4444`) |

Weather penalties are applied globally to all segments based on the live forecast at the route's midpoint. This means the same trail can shift from Easy to Moderate on a hot or rainy day, giving hikers a real-time awareness of conditions.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: Component-based UI with hooks and refs for state management and imperative map control.
- **TypeScript 5**: Full type safety across all components, hooks, utilities, and API responses.
- **Vite 6**: Lightning-fast development server and optimized production builds.
- **Mapbox GL JS 3**: 3-D satellite map rendering with DEM terrain, sky layers, and programmatic camera control.
- **@mapbox/togeojson**: GPX-to-GeoJSON conversion for trackpoint extraction.
- **Open-Meteo API**: Free weather forecast API providing daily max temperature and precipitation sum.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Open your terminal and install the required packages:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/KhalidHossainGitHub/hikeWise-v2.git
     cd hikeWise-v2
     npm install
     ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your free [Mapbox access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/):
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Open `.env` and add your token:
     ```
     VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.your_token_here
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

4. **Explore a Trail**:
   - Pick one of the five pre-loaded **Sample Trails** to explore instantly, or drag-and-drop your own `.gpx` file onto the upload zone.
   - The map will fly to your route and render color-coded difficulty segments on 3-D terrain.
   - Use the **sidebar panel** (desktop) or **bottom drawer** (mobile) to view the route summary, switch map styles, recenter the camera, and click individual segments to fly to them.
   - Click **↩ Load another GPX** to reset and try a different trail.
